# Note Taker

## Description

This application allows a user to take and save notes throughout the day. This will allow the user the ability to clear their mind and be able to focus on creating rather than remembering. Each note can be given a title and a description. The notes are then saved and can be deleted when they are no longer needed. This app allowed me to practice working with Express.js. I had the chance to work on setting up view and api routes.

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

To use this app click the link below to be brought to the homepage. Once on the homepage click on the "Get Started" button. This will bring you to the main notes page. Here you can create a new note by entering in the note title and description in the right portion of the page. You can add more notes using the plus button in the top right corner.

After you have written a new note that note can be saved with the save icon in the top right. Saved notes will be organized on the left portion of the page. These notes can be clicked on in order to bring them back to the right side of the screen.

If a note is no longer needed, there is a red trash can icon that can be clicked to delete notes.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
